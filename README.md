üìö Library Management System
A robust and simple console-based application built in C++ for managing a collection of books and user accounts in a library setting.

‚ú® Features
This system provides essential library management functionalities, including:

Book Management: Add new books, search by title, author, or ISBN, and view the complete book catalog.

User Management: Register new users, manage existing user details, and search user records.

Borrowing/Returning: Track the issuing and returning of books with due date checks.

Data Persistence: Data is stored in a file (e.g., books.dat, users.dat) to ensure information is preserved between sessions.

üöÄ Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for operational use.

Prerequisites
To run the pre-compiled executable (library.exe), you simply need a Windows operating system.

Running the Application
Download: Ensure you have the library.exe file.

Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where library.exe is located using your command prompt or terminal.

Execute: Run the application with the following command:

Bash

./library.exe
(Note: If the application uses external data files, ensure they are in the same directory.)

Follow Prompts: The application is console-based. Follow the on-screen menu and prompts to interact with the system.

üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source
If you have the original C++ source files (.cpp, .h), you can compile the application yourself.

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler, such as G++ (MinGW), Clang, or Visual Studio C++.

The required source files: [e.g., main.cpp, Book.h, User.cpp].

Compilation
Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the source code. If using g++:

Bash

# General compilation command
g++ [Your_Source_Files].cpp -o library

# Example command with specific flags (Common for C++11/14/17)
g++ -std=c++17 [main.cpp Book.cpp User.cpp] -o library
After compilation, an executable file (e.g., library or library.exe) will be created, which you can run as described above.

üíª Usage
The system is entirely menu-driven via the console.

Main Menu: Upon starting, you will be presented with the main options (e.g., Book Operations, User Operations, Issue/Return, Exit).

Input: Enter the number corresponding to your desired action.

Data Entry: The program will prompt you for any necessary input (e.g., book ID, user name, dates).
